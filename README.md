# simple-hue-control-racket
Simple Program to Control Philip Hue Lights in a Theatrical Setting. Currently written in Racket.  

## Overview

This program was originally created for [Superhero Clubhouse's](http://www.superheroclubhouse.org) 2015-07 workshop of [*Earth*](http://www.superheroclubhouse.org/earth/). The project took place in a studio setting, without a theatrical lighting system, and half the play was created by the audience during the event. In order to collaborate with the ensemble in real time, I used [Philip Hue Bulbs](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/) as they provide wireless control and color changing ability. I am providing the code of the program I created for those who wish to produce their own production of *Earth* from the Atlas or for those who want to experiment with other theatrical uses of these bulbs.  

## Notes

I am only providing the source code and not a compiled binary as there are still hard coded aspects (such as the user name) that will need to be changed for the program to be functional. A free download of [Dr. Racket](http://download.racket-lang.org/) is needed to run or compile the software. Moreover, familiarity with the [Philip Hue API](http://www.developers.meethue.com/philips-hue-api) is highly recommended.  

**Some Limitations:** 

* There is currently no way to patch lights, so the bulbs must be controlled in the order that they have been registered with the Hue Bridge.  

* Everything runs on the main thread, so larger RESTful commands freeze the program as they are executed.  

* For theatrical purposes, a dedicated router—not connected to the internet—is recommended.  

* I've only run the program on Mac OS X 10.9 and 10.10 and Racket v 6.0. I have no clue how it will function on other platforms.
